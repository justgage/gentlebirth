    <h1>Hello, I'm Karla</h1>
    <p>I fell in love with the process of birth while giving birth to my own 6 children, and as labor support for my family and friends.</p>
    <p>I have been involved with the care of women and babies for close to 20 years, first as a doula, then as a Labor and Delivery nurse, and now as a Certified Nurse Midwife.</p>
    <p>In those 20 years I have attended more than 2,000 births, many as a L&amp;D nurse in the hospital, where I was always the go-to nurse for the women who wanted a natural, unmedicated birth.</p>
    <p>As a Certified Nurse Midwife (CNM) I now offer women the choice of out-of-hospital birth; the natural and safe delivery of babies in their home, or in a birth center, where it can unfold in an unhurried, peaceful, and loving manner.</p>

  quote: I firmly believe in a womanâ€™s right to choose her provider and the manner
    in which she gives birth, knowing that if a woman is given education and support
    she will choose what is best for her and her family.

    <p>As a CNM I can prescribe medication, if it&rsquo;s needed, but most often find that herbs or other alternative modalities can take care of many common conditions.</p>
    <p>I also educate women about their bodies throughout their lifespan, promoting good health and nutrition. I am licensed as a Certified Nurse Midwife and educated as a Women&rsquo;s Health Nurse Practitioner.</p>

      Karla Bennett was a wonderful midwife! She is very calm and confident with what she does and I felt that I could completely trust her judgment. I never felt like she was pushy at all and only gave me constant encouragement and reassurance that I could complete the amazing journey of pregnancy and childbirth. This is such a vulnerable time for mom and having someone who takes the time to listen and help you feel secure is invaluable! Karla truly felt like a friend who was excited about and invested in me and my baby.

      I also felt that I could really trust Karla as a midwife with her eight years previous experience as a labor and delivery nurse. I imagine she has seen almost every birth scenario there is. Strangely enough after finding Karla online as a potential midwife I recognized her right away. She was the nurse 6 years ago that helped me when I was in labor with my son at the local hospital! I loved her then and love her now as my midwife. Thanks Karla for you true gift of caring about others and guiding them on this special journey.

    excerpt: "...beyond the standard of care most women receive during pregnancy."
    content: I recently gave birth to my first baby with Karla as my midwife.She was
      professional but also very personal, going above and beyond the standard of
      care most women receive during pregnancy. I had such a positive and comfortable
      experience and I know it was all because of her exceptional care. My labor was
      smooth and full of positive vibes. I will definitely go to her again!
