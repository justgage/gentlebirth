I recently gave birth to my first baby with Karla as my midwife.She was professional but also very personal, going above and beyond the standard of care most women receive during pregnancy. I had such a positive and comfortable experience and I know it was all because of her exceptional care. My labor was smooth and full of positive vibes. I will definitely go to her again!
