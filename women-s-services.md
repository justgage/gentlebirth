## Gynecology and Well woman

Because of our commitment to the concept of respectful holistic care, we offer many necessary women's health services such as yearly exams, premarital and pre-pregnancy counseling, contraception options, menopause and hormone balancing.

## Menopause, Perimenopause, and Hormone Balancing

We can help you make this, sometimes uncomfortable transition, using nutrition and lifestyle counseling, as well as monitoring and replacing necessary hormones using herbal support and bioidentical hormones.

## Nutrition and Weight Management

Most of us know how important good nutrition and maintaining an optimal weight is to good health, but are confused about all the conflicting information out there. We can help you develop a workable plan to help you with your fitness goals.

## Pricing

Our Women's services are priced to be affordable. The cost for a basic visit is $75 for a 30 minute visit. Lab work, pap tests and other needed testing are additional, but are also very reasonable.
