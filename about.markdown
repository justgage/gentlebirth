I fell in love with the process of birth while giving birth to my own 6 children, and as labor support for my family and friends.

I have been involved with the care of women and babies for close to 20 years, first as a doula, then as a Labor and Delivery nurse, and now as a Certified Nurse Midwife.

In those 20 years I have attended more than 2,000 births, many as a L&D nurse in the hospital, where I was always the go-to nurse for the women who wanted a natural, unmedicated birth.

As a Certified Nurse Midwife (CNM) I now offer women the choice of out-of-hospital birth; the natural and safe delivery of babies in their home, or in a birth center, where it can unfold in an unhurried, peaceful, and loving manner.

I firmly believe in a woman's right to choose her provider and the manner in which she gives birth, knowing that if a woman is given education and support she will choose what is best for her and her family.

I love educating women about their pregnancies and births, fostering trust in the normalcy and beauty of natural childbirth, and supporting families as they create births that are gentle and safe.

As a CNM I can prescribe medication, if it's needed, but most often find that herbs or other alternative modalities can take care of many common conditions.

I also educate women about their bodies throughout their lifespan, promoting good health and nutrition.   I am licensed as a Certified Nurse Midwife and educated as a Women's Health Nurse Practitioner.
