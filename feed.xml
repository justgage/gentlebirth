She is very calm and confident with what she does and I felt that I could completely trust her judgement. I never felt like she was pushy at all and only gave me constant encouragement and reassurance that I could complete the amazing journey of pregnancy and childbirth. This is such a vulnerable time for mom and having someone who takes the time to listen and help you feel secure is invaluable! Karla truly felt like a friend who was excited about and invested in me and my baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also felt that I could really trust Karla as a midwife with her eight years previous experience as a labor and delivery nurse. I imagine she has seen almost every birth scenario there is. Strangely enough after finding Karla online as a potential midwife I recognized her right away. She was the nurse 6 years ago that helped me when I was in labor with my son at the local hospital! I loved her then and love her now as my midwife. Thanks Karla for you true gift of caring about others and guiding them on this special journey.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Karla Bennett was a wonderful midwife!

She was professional but also very personal, going above and beyond the standard of care most women receive during pregnancy. I had such a positive and comfortable experience and I know it was all because of her exceptional care. My labor was smooth and full of positive vibes. I will definitely go to her again!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I recently gave birth to my first baby with Karla as my midwife.
