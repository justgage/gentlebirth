## Lower chance of catching a disease

Isn't it odd that the place we choose to have a helpless baby with a vulnerable immune system is the place with the highest concentration of sick people? At home you and your baby are not exposed to any of the unfamiliar diseases that exist in hospital. In hospitals there's about a  _25% chance of postpartum infection_, compared to about 4% in homebirth mothers (see the [National Birthday Trust Fund study](http://www.homebirth.org.uk/homebirth2.htm))
