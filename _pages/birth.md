    <h3 class="font_7">PREGNANCY AND BIRTH</h3>
    <p class="font_7">I believe and support birth as a natural process which, in most cases, happens spontaneously and needs no intervention, only watchful care. Because my clients know that this is&nbsp;their&nbsp;baby and&nbsp;their&nbsp;pregnancy, I teach and counsel each one throughout their pregnancies so that they have enough information to feel comfortable making decisions regarding their care and the birth of their baby. &nbsp;</p>
    <p class="font_7">I specialize in home birth, including water birth, but also have birth center options as well.&nbsp; I provide complete prenatal care, including lab work and ultrasound, conducting the visits in your home. I monitor the progress of your pregnancy and the growth of your baby with close and experienced observation.&nbsp; I join you in your home for the birth of your baby and stay after the delivery, making sure both mama and baby are healthy and stable. I have a large, comfortable birth tub, that you can rent if you prefer a water birth. My care also includes several postpartum visits, the first of which is in your home 1 day after your birth</p>
