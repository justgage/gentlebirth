This practice is founded on the principle of choice for women; choice about their births, and about their health.

We believe that as we teach and support all our clients, throughout their lifespan, they also will make healthy and educated choices about their own health care..

We provide **one-on-one attention** from an experienced Certified Nurse Midwife, committed to protecting your birth and your health.

## Pregnancy and Birth

We believe and support birth as a natural, normal and beautiful process.  We specialize in home birth, whether in the water or out, but have birth center options as well. We offer complete prenatal care, including lab work and ultrasound.

## Lactation Support

breastfeeding is to you so we help your baby to successfully breastfeed before we leave your home after your birth. We offer individual follow-up support, helping you to have an enjoyable breastfeeding experience.

## Pricing

The cost for our birth services is one flat fee of $3,500, which covers all necessary and customary cost including:

- all 12-13 of your prenatal visits

- customary laboratory fees

- your mid trimester anatomy ultrasound

- your birth

- and 2-4 postpartum visits for you and your baby.

- your baby's hearing and cardiac screening, and metabolic screen collection.

A discount for early payment may be available.

If you need any additional treatments, such as IV therapy or antibiotics, or if you choose to give your baby vitamin K or eye ointment, there are additional, but reasonable costs. Rhogam for Rh-negative women is also extra.

A statement will be provided, with proper codes, that you can submit to your insurance company for reimbursement, if applicable. Your claims may also be submitted for reimbursement through many insurance companies.
