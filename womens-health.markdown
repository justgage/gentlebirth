_This practice is founded on the principle of choice for women; choice about their births, and about their health._

_We believe that as we teach and support all our clients, throughout their lifespan, they also will make healthy and educated choices about their own health care.._

_We provide **one-on-one attention** from an experienced Certified Nurse Midwife, committed to protecting your birth and your health._

## Pregnancy and Birth

We believe and support birth as a natural, normal and beautiful process.  We specialize in home birth, whether in the water or out, but have birth center options as well. We offer complete prenatal care, including lab work and ultrasound.

## Gynecology and Well woman

Because of our commitment to the concept of respectful holistic care, we offer many necessary women's health services such as yearly exams, premarital and pre-pregnancy counseling, contraception options, menopause and hormone balancing.

## Lactation Support

We know how important breastfeeding is to you so we help your baby to successfully breastfeed before we leave your home after your birth. We offer individual follow-up support,  helping you to have an enjoyable breastfeeding experience.

## Menopause, Perimenopause, and Hormone Balancing

We can help you make this, sometimes uncomfortable transition, using nutrition and lifestyle counseling, as well as monitoring and replacing necessary hormones using herbal support and bioidentical hormones.

## Nutrition and Weight Management

Most of us know how important good nutrition and maintaining an optimal weight is to good health, but are confused about all the conflicting information out there. We can help you develop a workable plan to help you with your fitness goals.
