This practice is founded on the principle of choice for women; choice about their births, and about their health.

We believe that as we teach and support all our clients, throughout their lifespan, they also will make healthy and educated choices about their own health care..

We provide **one-on-one attention** from an experienced Certified Nurse Midwife, committed to protecting your birth and your health.

## Pregnancy and Birth

We believe and support birth as a natural, normal and beautiful process.  We specialize in home birth, whether in the water or out, but have birth center options as well. We offer complete prenatal care, including lab work and ultrasound.

## Lactation Support

breastfeeding is to you so we help your baby to successfully breastfeed before we leave your home after your birth. We offer individual follow-up support, helping you to have an enjoyable breastfeeding experience.
