<p>I fell in love with the process of birth while giving birth to my own 6 children, and as labor support for my family and friends.</p>

<p>I have been involved with the care of women and babies for close to 20 years, first as a doula, then as a Labor and Delivery nurse, and now as a Certified Nurse Midwife.</p>

<p>In those 20 years I have attended more than 2,000 births, many as a L&amp;D nurse in the hospital, where I was always the go-to nurse for the women who wanted a natural, unmedicated birth.</p>

<p>As a Certified Nurse Midwife (CNM) I now offer women the choice of out-of-hospital birth; the natural and safe delivery of babies in their home, or in a birth center, where it can unfold in an unhurried, peaceful, and loving manner.</p>

<p>I firmly believe in a woman’s right to choose her provider and the manner in which she gives birth, knowing that if a woman is given education and support she will choose what is best for her and her family.</p>

<p>I love educating women about their pregnancies and births, fostering trust in the normalcy and beauty of natural childbirth, and supporting families as they create births that are gentle and safe.</p>

<p>As a CNM I can prescribe medication, if it’s needed, but most often find that herbs or other alternative modalities can take care of many common conditions.</p>

<p>I also educate women about their bodies throughout their lifespan, promoting good health and nutrition.   I am licensed as a Certified Nurse Midwife and educated as a Women’s Health Nurse Practitioner.</p>
